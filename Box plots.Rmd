## Introduction

Box-and-whisker plots give a visual indication of the spread of data point values for a continuous numerical variable.

The central box has as its upper margin (on the $y$-axis) the third quarterly value and as it lower margin the first quarterly value.  A central bar in the box shows the median.

The whisker stretch up and down from the ends of the box and can terminate at the minimum and maximum values.  Some plots, though terminate their whiskers at $1.5$ times the IQR above and below the quartile values, so as to show any potential outliers beyond them.

## Simulating some data

In this tutorial we will be working with some simulated numerical and categorical variables.  In the code chunk below we create these and add them to a tibble.

A tibble is a more _modern_ version of the inbuilt R `data.frame`.  We can print it to the screen when we render this RMD file using `knitr`.  This is done with the `DT` package.

The numerical variable will be that of income.  We will create a categorical variable for career stage and country.

```{r Creating simulated data}
set.seed(1234)
# Create three varaible
income <- round(rnorm(500,
                      mean = 10000,
                      sd = 1000),
                digits = 2)
stage <- sample(c("Early",
                  "Mid",
                  "Late"),
                500,
                replace = TRUE)
country <- sample(c("USA",
                    "Canada"),
                  500,
                  replace = TRUE)
# Create tibble
df <- tibble(Income = income,
             Stage = stage,
             Country = country)
# Print a data table
datatable(df)
```

## Simple box-and-whisker plot

In the code chunk below is a simple box-and-whisker plot of the income for all the simulated survey members.

```{r Box plot of income}
p1 <- plot_ly(type = "box",
              y = ~Income,
              data = df,
              name = "All income") %>% 
  layout(title = "Overall income",
         xaxis = list(title = "",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p1
```

## Horizontal plots

Horizontal box plots are easy to create, we simply swap the axes.

```{r Horizontal box plot of income}
p2 <- plot_ly(type = "box",
              x = ~Income,
              data = df,
              name = "All income") %>% 
  layout(title = "Overall income",
         yaxis = list(title = "",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         xaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p2
```

## Adding all the data point values

We can add all the data point values.  Since there are many with potential overlap, we add a bit of hitter.  The jitter can also be offset so as not to overlay the box.

```{r Box plot wth all the data point value}
p3 <- plot_ly(type = "box",
              y = ~Income,
              data = df,
              name = "All income",
              boxpoints = "all",
              jitter = 0.3,
              pointpos = -2) %>% 
  layout(title = "Overall income",
         xaxis = list(title = "",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p3
```

## Adding a mean and a standard deviation

As mentioned the central box shows a line for the median.  The mean can also be added.  This is done by adding the `boxmean = TRUE` argument.  If the argument is set to `boxmean = "sd`, then both a mean and standard deviation is indicated.

```{r Adding a mean}
p4 <- plot_ly(type = "box",
              y = ~Income,
              data = df,
              name = "All income",
              boxmean = "sd") %>% 
  layout(title = "Overall income",
         xaxis = list(title = "",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p4
```


## Creating more than one box in a box plot

We can use the `color = ` argument to split the numerical variable according to one of the categorical variables.

```{r Creating three box plots according to the Stage variable}
p5 <- plot_ly(df,
              y = ~Income,
              color = ~Stage,
              type = "box") %>% 
  layout(title = "Income by career stage",
         xaxis = list(title = "Stage",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p5
```

```{r Creating three box plots according to the Stage variable, grouped by country}
p6 <- plot_ly(df,
              x = ~Country,
              y = ~Income,
              color = ~Stage,
              type = "box") %>% 
  layout(boxmode = "group",
         title = "Income by career stage",
         xaxis = list(title = "Country",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p6
```

## Changing the outlier marker shape

There are many different shapes to choose from.  Below we make the outliers square.

```{r Changing outlier marker shape}
p7 <- plot_ly(type = "box",
              y = ~Income,
              data = df,
              name = "All income",
              marker = list(symbol = "square-dot")) %>% 
  layout(title = "Overall income",
         xaxis = list(title = "",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p7
```

## Box color

The color of the box and its outline can be selected.

```{r Box fill and outline colors}
p8 <- plot_ly(type = "box",
              y = ~Income,
              data = df,
              name = "All income",
              marker = list(symbol = "square-dot"),
              fillcolor = "pink",
              line = list(color = "gray",
                          width = 2)) %>% 
  layout(title = "Overall income",
         xaxis = list(title = "",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p8
```

## Choosing a color set

There are many color sets to choose from.  Here we use `Set(3)`.

```{r Coosing a color set}
p7 <- plot_ly(type = "box",
              y = ~Income,
              color = ~Country,
              data = df,
              marker = list(symbol = "square-dot"),
              colors = "Set3") %>% 
  layout(title = "Overall income",
         xaxis = list(title = "Country",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Income",
                      zeroline = FALSE))
p7
```
